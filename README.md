## 1st Model:
  71.60%
  - This indicates a good level of model performance, although it has room for improvement.
## 2nd Model:
  73.13%
  - This indicates that there was an improvement made to the accuracy of the tuner, although slight, and improvements could be made here.
  
### Questions:
## Data Preprocessing
Q: What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? : Classification

Q: What variable(s) are the features for your model? : 'Application Type', 'Is_Successful'

Q: What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? : EIN, NAME

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
Q: How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? For model 1 there were three layers, two hidden. In model 2 I decided to perform 50+ trial iterations.

Q: Were you able to achieve the target model performance? A: Unfortunately, it was not possible to achieve or replicate 75% accuracy.

Q: What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance? A: I increased the layers to 56 and attained an accuracy of 73.13%

## Summary
In summary, although the overall accuracy of model 1 was good, model 2 improved upon the accuracy of model 1 even with only a few trials being run. In the future I could perform more iterations to potentially improve accuracy. Overall however, I believe that it is almost impossible to attain an accuracy of 75%.
